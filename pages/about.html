<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
  I've lived in ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹Italy, ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·Brazil, ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡¿New Zealand and now ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡­Switzerland. I can speak fluent Italian,
  English and Portuguese, and am trying to learn German (it's hard!). I've practiced a bunch of sports
  in the past, like football, sailing and martial arts (sanda), although right now you will most likely
  find me climbing or hiking.

<p>
  I'm very curious about all things Computer Science, from managing Linux servers to training 3D
  shape reconstructors. My academic interests span from 3D Computer Vision to studying LLMs and
  their ability to generalize out-of-domain, while on a personal level I have a very profund
  appreciation for writing low-level performance-critical code in many different contexts.
